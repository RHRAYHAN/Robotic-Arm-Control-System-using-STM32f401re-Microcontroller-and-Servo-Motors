# Robotic-Arm-Control-System-using-STM32f401re-Microcontroller-and-Servo-Motors
Programmed in C and implemented the I2C protocol for user-robot communication. Used Proteus for design. Robotics has been a tremendous successful field of
research in last few decades. Regarding the development of
robotics, many developed robotic arm has been deployed in
industrial purposes like automation, sophisticated fabrication etc.
This paper is an initiative to patronize the robotic arm for
hazardous situation people who can use his hand to move object
within certain range to carry out that job. This project is meant
to designing and developing of a microcontroller (ATmega) based
robotic arm. The project delivers a combined implementation of
Electrical, Electronic as well as Mechanical gen. The robotic arm
responds to the gesture as well as can be programmed to go along
a definite path and task.
The system senses the movement of userâ€™s arm and robotic
arm replicates the given input gesture. The gesture is sensed by a
number of potentiometers which are embedded onto a glove or
other structural attachment. The movement in potentiometer
determines the position for the servo motors driving the parts of
the arm.
